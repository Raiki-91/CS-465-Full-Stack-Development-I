# CS-465-Full-Stack-Development-I
Portfolio for CS-465

## Architecture
In my full stack project, I worked with various frontend technologies, including Express with HTML, JavaScript, and a single-page application (SPA) framework. Express served as a lightweight web application framework, allowing me to render dynamic content efficiently while managing server-side logic. Traditional HTML and JavaScript provided basic interactivity, but the SPA approach, using a framework like React, enhanced the user experience by reducing page reloads and improving responsiveness. The SPA architecture allows for seamless client-side rendering, making it a more modern and dynamic choice for web applications.

The backend leveraged a NoSQL MongoDB database due to its flexibility, scalability, and ability to handle unstructured or semi-structured data. Unlike relational databases, MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents, which aligns well with JavaScript-based applications. This schema-less nature allowed for rapid iteration and changes to the data structure without requiring complex migrations.

## Functionality
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data format used for communication between the frontend and backend. While JavaScript is a programming language used to manipulate web content, JSON is a structured way to store and exchange data. JSONâ€™s key-value format enables seamless interaction between the client and server, making it essential for APIs.

During development, I frequently refactored code to improve efficiency and maintainability. For example, I restructured API calls by centralizing them into a single service, reducing redundancy and improving scalability. Additionally, I utilized reusable UI components in the frontend, which enhanced consistency and reduced development time. Components like buttons, modals, and form elements were designed to be modular, allowing for easier maintenance and updates.

## Testing
API testing is a crucial part of full stack development, ensuring that endpoints function correctly and securely. Methods define the type of request made to the server, such as GET for retrieving data, POST for creating new entries, PUT for updating, and DELETE for removal. Each endpoint must be tested for expected responses, error handling, and performance.

Security adds complexity to testing, especially when dealing with authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth) and authorization layers. Testing protected endpoints required simulating authentication tokens and verifying that unauthorized requests were properly rejected. Tools like Postman and automated testing frameworks helped validate API functionality and security.

## Reflection
This course has been instrumental in helping me advance my professional goals by strengthening my skills in full stack development. I gained hands-on experience with frontend and backend technologies, API design, database management, and software testing. These skills make me a more competitive candidate in the software engineering field, particularly for roles involving web development and API integration. Additionally, I improved my problem-solving abilities and learned best practices for writing efficient, scalable, and secure code, which are critical for success in the industry.
